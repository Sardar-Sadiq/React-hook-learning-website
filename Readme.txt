Core React Hooks (Must-know):

    useState: For adding state to components.

    useEffect: For side effects like data fetching and DOM manipulation.

    useContext: For global state management.

Next.js Hooks (Essential for the App Router):

    useRouter: To programmatically navigate between pages.

    usePathname: To get the current URL's pathname.

    useSearchParams: To read and manipulate URL query parameters.

    use client: This isn't a hook, but it's a crucial directive to mark components that need to run on the client side.
